# Just a simple memory game made using HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Verson 1 and verson 2 are the same, just coded in different ways

### How to play:

1. Each player chooses a symbol to represent them, such as an X or an O.
2. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins.
4. If all squares are filled and no one has three in a row, the game is a tie
